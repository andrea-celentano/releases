<b>GE</b>ant4 <b>M</b>onte-<b>C</b>arlo


<b>gemc</b> is an application based on Geant4 libraries to simulate the 
passage of particles through matter.


The simulation models are stored on databases (MYSQL for example). This makes <b>gemc</b> ideal for 
collaborations as any change in the models can be tested and used immediately by all users.

### Overview:

gemc tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible.

Users can build and run complex setups even with no C++ or geant4 knowledge.

The upload/download of the parameters to/from databases (available: MYSQL or ASCII) is automatic.
