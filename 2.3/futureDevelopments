GEMC Future Development

New features:
=============

- hybrid banks (for FADC)
- multihit
- geant4 multithreading
- hit process routines > plugins to be stored with the geometry routines
- proMC output

Code Improvements:
==================

- physics details choices (disable some physics, etc on the GUI)
- culling options combobox
- move timewindow to general generator tab - make all other the same
- remove obsolete cpp materials
- "ahit" general function to get infos (with auto, c++11) getVector(string), get3Vector(string)
  check performance hit
- speed up the search for same identifier
- add generic "system" that contains a list detectors, sensitive det, materials?
- optimize eventaction - too many vector<hitOutput> definitions? Can they br grouped?
- add DEBUG ifdefs for debugging part of code
- general color map to be used by geant4 / gui , maybe part of options?
- bring some guis out of main gui, pop up windows?
- re-define and document all verbosities
- get screen resolution and adjust gui dimensions to that
- match detector types to geant4
- add /tracking/storeTrajectory 4 button
- add track verbosity output
- add options for particles color
- is atof thread safe?
- move all user actions in their directory:
  ActionInitialization
  PrimaryGenerator
  SteppingAction
- gemcOptions make it a library, pass it by reference not value!
  make calls like gemcOpt->get3Vector("BEAM_V")

Add production cut verbosity?

If you want to know the traslation from an energy cut value to a range cut value for a given
particle in a given material, you can do with the following instructions.
First you have to instantiate the user action

/gamos/userAction GmCutsEnergy2RangeUA

and then you can use the command

/gamos/physics/ECuts2RangeCuts MATERIAL_NAME CUT_VALUE PARTICLE_NAME

You may use in the material name an '*' if you want to name several materials at the same time.
For the particle name only the following names have a meaning: gamma, e-, e+, e*, *.
This will produce a table with the conversion for each material and particle similar to the following one:

GmCutsEnergy2RangeUA:  MATERIAL:  G4_AIR  PART: gamma
ENERGY CUT: 0.1 (MeV)  = RANGE CUT: 286588
GmCutsEnergy2RangeUA:  MATERIAL:  G4_AIR  PART: e-
ENERGY CUT: 0.1 (MeV)  = RANGE CUT: 129.155
GmCutsEnergy2RangeUA:  MATERIAL:  G4_AIR  PART: e+
ENERGY CUT: 0.1 (MeV)  = RANGE CUT: 131.938
GmCutsEnergy2RangeUA:  MATERIAL:  G4_WATER  PART: gamma
ENERGY CUT: 0.1 (MeV)  = RANGE CUT: 334.152
GmCutsEnergy2RangeUA:  MATERIAL:  G4_WATER  PART: e-
ENERGY CUT: 0.1 (MeV)  = RANGE CUT: 0.134781
GmCutsEnergy2RangeUA:  MATERIAL:  G4_WATER  PART: e+
ENERGY CUT: 0.1 (MeV)  = RANGE CUT: 0.137686



Code Reorganization:
====================

- bring output structure out of gemc - general library
- bring options out of gemc - general library 
- bring splash screen out of util - general library
- re-organize primary generator, use external library project
