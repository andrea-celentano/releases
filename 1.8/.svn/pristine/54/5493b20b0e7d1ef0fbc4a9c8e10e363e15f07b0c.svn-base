# Change number of colors to 32 will help size (gimp: image>mode>indexed)
# Need to save the images in xpm file first.
# For transparency:
# 1 Select region to be transparent
# 2 Colors > To Alpha
# 3 Notice: jpg doesn't support transparency but xpm does. 

# After saving in xpm, set size to 96x85

# mv *.xpm ../src/images/
# Then change the type to static const char *
# Then move it to _xpm.h  (then it's same name as the object)
