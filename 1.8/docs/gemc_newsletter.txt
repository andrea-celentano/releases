Hi all,

below is a summary of the main changes/bug fixes for gemc in the last few months, 
and an outline on what is being worked on. This letter is also going to the gemc_software 
mailing to keep the record.

* HTCC mirrors and mirrors-supports are now inserted in gemc. 
  This was an awesome job by UCONN student Nathan Harrison. 
  The optics are tested. Further tests are underway and a CLAS 
  note will be available soon.

* A new button on the GUI interface: the "Infos" button provides data on the 
  gemc version, the particles color code, the LUND format. I plan to expand 
  this as per user requests.

* Maurik Holtrop is now providing one-click installation of gemc on Macs running 10.5 or 10.6:
  see http://clasweb.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/Mac_OS_X_-_easy_package_installation

* All unnecessary STL object lookups are moved from Sensitive Detector to 
  Event Action. This cleans up the code and should speed up things.

* Bug fix: when running in interactive mode, the sliders caused too much an 
  approximation on the angles of the generated particles. The precision is 
  now increased to 0.05 degrees.  

* Bug Fix: Mother particle information (PID, vertex). Previously gemc could only 
  record this information correctly only if both mom and daughter particles passes 
  through the same sensitive volume. Now the "absolute" correct genealogy is recorded.

* Charge of the particle for each step is added in the hit information

* All Hit infos are now kept for each step in the Hit in the form of STL <vector>s. 
  See MHit.h for infos on how to access these vectors in the hitprocess routines. 

* By default now gemc uses OpenGL QT "Immediate" mode. This might be a bit slow on 
  some old videocard. With USE_QT=4, one can use the faster "Stored" mode. 
  to update the image on screen)

* Colors for tracks are changed:

  * neutrons black
  * photons blue
  * e- cyan
  * protons orange

  * pi+ magenta
  * pi- yellow

  all other particle colours will be based on their charges:

  * q=+1 red
  * q= 0 white
  * q=-1 green

` Working on:
`````````````
A major re-design of the database I/O system is now due. This includes:

a. The gemc mysql server will not be clasdb anymore. 
   It will be either an existing virtual machine (gemc.jlab.org) or some other CC server.
b. Any users will have the ability to create their own copy 
   of the clas12_geometry database with a form available on the web.
   Users will also be able to I/O their databases with the usual tools.
b2. The "usual" tools will be improved in term of user friendlyness.
c. Better organization of the variables. There are currently overlaps of 
   tables, variables and databases that need clean up.
d. Offline mode: making gemc working if no web connection is available
e. Considering other databases (sqlite). 

Furthermore:

f. More code clean up 
g. Organization some non gemc-specific functions in headers and libraries
   outside of gemc
h. Physics List: the "gemc" physics list.
i. Improvement on the gemc.jlab.org website, including integration of reconstruction code and 
   launching simulation jobs on the CC farm.
j. Geometry: determining "core" informations from which all geometry can be extracted.

` gemc Tips
```````````
* If you can't use gemc in GUI mode, try -USE_QT=2 or -USE_QT=3 or -USE_QT=4 (new). 
  That will not use direct rendering (problematic on old videocards)
* If you can use gemc normally, remember you can navigate through the 
  picture google-earth style with the mouse
* gemc -help will provide help categories. Then type help-specific commands to get
  the full documentation. Example: -help-generator.
  All categories:
  
  >  -help-all:  all available options. 
  
  >  -help-control             control options.
  >  -help-general             general options.
  >  -help-generator           generator options.
  >  -help-luminosity          luminosity options.
  >  -help-mysql               mysql options.
  >  -help-output              output options.
  >  -help-physics             physics options.
  >  -help-verbosity           verbosity options.
