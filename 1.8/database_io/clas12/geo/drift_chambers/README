1. Program 'dc12_geometry.for'
   a. originally copied from ~mestayer/public_html/upgrade/dc12_geometry.for  
   b. Calculates wire positions based on 7 parameters (with 6 values each for the 6 superlayers)
   c. Calculates parameters necessary for defining GEANT volumes
         "Mother"   volume  = shape of one region of one sector DC "box"
         "Daughter" volumes = layers of sense wires contained within a "mother" volume
          Both "mother" and "daughter" volumes are trapezoids described by G4TRAP
   d. Current output of dc12_geometry_mac.for consists of two data files: 
      mother-geometry.dat and layer-geometry.dat



2. Script 'dc12_geometry.pl' reads "mother-geometry.dat" and "layer-geometry.dat" and 
   creates GEANT volumes 

3. Script 'go_table' executes 'dc12_geometry' for each region, and creates new geometry tables

program dc12.f
   based on dc12_geometry.for (to execute: f77 dc12.f, a.out)
   reads parameters from geometry.parm
   produces mother-geometry.dat and layer-geometry.dat

program dc12geom.cc + dc12geom.h (to execute: g++ dc12geom.cc \ a.out)
   does the same as dc12.f
